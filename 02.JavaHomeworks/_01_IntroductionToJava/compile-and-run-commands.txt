1. cd C:\console compilation                              // makes it current directory
2. set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_11\bin  // tells the system where to find JDK
3. javac _03_SumTwoNumbers.java                           //  create a class file 
4. java _03_SumTwoNumbers                                 //runs the class file 

And the program is working just fine :)) 

//cd - goes in to next dir 
//dir - shows the folders in the selected directory
